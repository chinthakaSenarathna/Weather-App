## ‚öôÔ∏è Auth0 Configuration

Note: The test account provided in the assignment instructions (careers@fidenz.com) could not be created due to Auth0 limitations.
To proceed with testing, I created my own Auth0 account and registered few users and then diable Sign up.
Only those pre-registered users can access the application.
